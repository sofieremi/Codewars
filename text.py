a = 'On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike ' \
    'men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of ' \
    'the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and' \
    ' trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in ' \
    'their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from' \
    ' toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In free hour,' \
    ' when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do' \
    ' what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain ' \
    'circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently ' \
    'occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always' \
    ' holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure' \
    ' other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.'
